I don't know what I'm doing here, don't use this for practical usage.

prototype.py is the actual working code, needs some changes but tweaking the max_threshold will help image detection rate.

script.py is first attempt of building this bot, but it doesn't work
script1.py is the second attempt of building this bot, I think it also doesn't work

all the other test files are just me testing each part of the bot to see if they work individually, like testing screen capturing, 
testing if the chatbot can send twitch messages, testing if the chatbot can read the target image file, testing if the chatbot can detect the image successfully on the screen.

others are just test images that I used to see if the image would be detected.

All and all I don't know what I'm doing I just vibe coded everything lmao
